# Pitch Detection

When jamming out, sometime you come up with a riff that your just can't remember af you finish your session and wish you had wrote it down.
This project seeks to fix that. By using live audio and Fourier Transforms, this project will detect the pitches being played at any time 
and record them. It will then convert the pitch into their respective notes and durations and transcribe the sheet music.
